## alpinejs_fragmentor

This project contains a directive and a magic property for AlpineJS
that allows you to load fragments of HTML into your page.

It's goal was to add some reactivity into Flask.

I'm planning to extend its functionality to support post requests, polling checks and Flask yield returns.
